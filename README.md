# Scripts
Some python/shell programs and some config files which I use

* **gbib** : Program to get .bib file given title of research paper from [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de). If there are multiple papers with the same name in DBLP
  (this can be because of same title for conference and journal versions or due to copies in arxiv), a list of choice is provided.

* **musb** : Mounts USB if automount fails. Also prints the mount location.
* **backlight** : Dim backlight on startup. Assumes that graphics card is Radeon. Should be placed in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/
* **pdfscale2up** : Script to scale a pdf given as input by 1.2 factor and 2x1 up (in landscape) using pdfjam.
* **backwhats** : For periodic backup of whatsapp folder in phone. Downloads only the new files added after the last backup. Will download all if there is no last backup. As of now backs
  up "Whatsapp Video", "Whatsapp Audio" and "Whatsapp Images" folders.
