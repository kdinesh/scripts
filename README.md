# Scripts
Some python/shell programs and some config files which I use

* **gbib** : Program to get .bib file given title of research paper from DBLP. If there are multiple papers with the same name in DBLP
  (this can be because of same title for conference and journal versions or due to copies in arxiv), a list of choice is provided.

* **musb** : Mounts USB if automount fails. Also prints the mount location.
