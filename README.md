# Scripts
Some python/shell programs and some config files which I use

* **gbib** : Program to get .bib file given title of research paper from [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de). If there are multiple papers with the same name in DBLP
  (this can be because of same title for conference and journal versions or due to copies in arxiv), a list of choice is provided.

* **musb** : Mounts USB if automount fails. Also prints the mount location.
* **backlight** : Dim backlight on startup. Assumes that graphics card is Radeon. Should be placed in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/
* **pdfscale2up** : Script to scale a pdf given as input by 1.2 factor and 2x1 up (in landscape) using pdfjam.
